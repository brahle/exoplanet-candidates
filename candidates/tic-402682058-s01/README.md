# TIC 402682058 / S01

**Provisional unclassified transit-like signal.** Source attribution and timing consistency are unresolved.
Binary, blend and instrumental explanations remain open. This is a dated evidence record, not a verified planet.

Diagnostic period: 1.7118000753 ± 3.41e-06 d.
Epoch: BJD_TDB 2458626.12770039 ± 0.00291 d.
Duration: 1.7163 h (uncertainty unavailable).
Linear-baseline depth: 1293.7 ± 112.8 ppm,
from 61 usable events in 5 sectors.
Errors are conditional diagnostic estimates.

Both saved baseline orders give positive aggregate dips. The minimum conditional depth/error
over sector leaveouts is 9.42; it is not a false-alarm probability.
Odd/even depth contrast: 0.296 conditional error units. The saved odd/even diagnostic supplies no definitive classification.
The [photometry](evidence/photometry.json) retains unusable events, alternate reductions,
phase controls and timestamp-withheld products. [Robustness](evidence/robustness.json),
[timing](evidence/timing-summary.json) and [alternative signals](evidence/alternative-summary.json)
retain adverse evidence, signed secondary/odd-even/harmonic probes and failures. Strong
secondary or odd/even differences can favour a binary explanation; those probes have not
been calibrated into a definitive classification.

The immutable discovery seed and adopted diagnostic hypothesis are in [settings](analysis-settings.json).
The aperture TIC is not an established physical host; Gaia DR3 association is deliberately null.

## Catalogue stellar context

The [pinned TIC/Gaia context](evidence/stellar-catalogue.json) supplies aperture-star Teff, radius, mass, TESS magnitude and distance with catalogue uncertainties. The structured host block marks the physical host and dilution unresolved; these are catalogue values, not a planet-radius inference. Gaia association: associated.

## Conditional duration uncertainty

The saved trapezoid duration now has a conditional error of 0.117626 hours. [Full shape covariance and exact replay](evidence/shape-uncertainty.json) retain the model, rank/bound checks and uncertainty limitations. This is a local Gaussian fit error with uncalibrated coverage. Physical transit geometry remains unfitted.
